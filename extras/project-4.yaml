description: "The North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (NPFMC) sets Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for all stocks and complexes listed in several Fisheries Management Plans. Currently, harvest regulations occurring for strata within each stock are informed by applying a smoother of available (and often highly uncertain) area-specific survey indices. However, this approach can result in large interannual variability in strata-specific harvest regulations, especially for stocks that are more challenging to survey or surveyed less frequently. In this project, we will investigate multiple alternative approaches to determine apportionment of subregional groundfish harvest in the Gulf of Alaska."
