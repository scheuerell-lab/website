description: "Toxic contaminants have been monitored for almost 30 years in some Puget Sound species (eg, flatfish, herring and salmon), but monitoring for toxics in the nearshore using mussels has only recently begun. Recovery goals for toxics typically mean reductions in contamination to levels that make the organisms safe for people to consume, or to levels that will not harm the animals. The design of this monitoring program will additionally consider recovery goals specifically tailored to communities impacted by contaminants in the nearshore. This project is intended to cut across otherwise disparate monitoring and recovery efforts, by joining ecological ideas with the social sciences to bring a more meaningful and environmentally just approach to ecosystem recovery. It will specifically seek out affected communities typically excluded from such decision-making, consider non-traditional concepts of health and vitality, and honor the full diversity of cultures using these resources."
