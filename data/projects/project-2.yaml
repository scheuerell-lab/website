description: "We are studying pink salmon in the Indian River, the lower course of which lies within the Sitka National Historical Park. Recent decades have seen what some believe to be unnaturally high pink salmon escapement in the river, which could be attributable to releases from the nearby Sheldon Jackson Hatchery. However, it is also possible that the recent high levels of abundance at Indian River may be consistent with those in the greater region. If the river is indeed seeing an unnatural overabundance of returners in the fall, the undue burden these salmon put on other aquatic species inhabiting the ecosystem would be  a cause of concern for park management. The goal of this project is to develop a statistical model of pink salmon abundance in northern SE Alaska. This model will be used to determine whether the abundances observed at Indian River are convincingly out of line with those seen elsewhere in the region. This effort requires the integration of pink and chum salmon survey data from multiple data sources in order to inform the model and establish a 'curve' on which to place the Indian River."
