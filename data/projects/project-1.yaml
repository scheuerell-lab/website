description: "In 2007, the Puget Sound steelhead (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). In support of efforts to evaluate the effects of various environmental drivers on the productivity, we developed an integrated population model for steelhead from the Skagit River basin. <br><br>You can find our data, code, and paper [here](https://github.com/mdscheuerell/steelhead_IPM)."
