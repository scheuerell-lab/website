description: "Artificial light at night (ALAN) is increasing nighttime brightness and expanding the time and area where salmon predators are highly effective foragers. Extended periods of elevated light can lead to decreased juvenile salmon survivorship during rearing and migration. Predation on juvenile salmon by fish predators is a main source of mortality for the Lake Washington salmon population. This population has experienced significant declines in the past few decades despite a longstanding moratorium on fishing. In collaboration with the WRIA-8 group and USGS, this project aims to identify areas of increased predation pressure due to ALAN in hopes of increasing juvenile salmon survival in the watershed. The objectives of this project are to 1) quantify the amount and seasonal trends of artificial light in the watershed at the surface and at depth 2) evaluate predation risk to juvenile salmon under current light levels using hydroacoustic sampling and previously developed visual foraging models 3) identify predation hot spots and to prioritize mitigation efforts."
