description: "Understanding the population status of these listed rockfish is necessary to 1) inform fisheries and habitat conservation management, 2) inform population targets identified in the Rockfish Recovery Plan (finished in 2017), and 3) potentially propose changing the listing status of these fishes under the ESA. To inform the recovery of this DPS, we reconstructed historical catches of this species within Puget Sound, collated historical and contemporary demographic data, and fit a data-limited stock assessment model to generate estimates of population status. You can find our data, code, and paper [**here**](https://github.com/markusmin/ESA_RF_2021/tree/main), and a press release for this project [**here**](https://fish.uw.edu/2023/10/looking-to-the-past-to-inform-the-future-historical-ecology-and-fisheries-stock-assessment-methods-shed-light-on-yelloweye-rockfish/)."
