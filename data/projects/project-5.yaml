description: "Understanding the population status of these listed rockfish is necessary to 1) inform fisheries and habitat conservation management, 2) inform population targets identified in the Rockfish Recovery Plan (finished in 2017), and 3) potentially propose changing the listing status of these fishes under the ESA. Improving our understanding of population status will entail collating and analyzing data from a variety of data sources. This project will assist NOAA Fisheries to conduct population assessments using contemporary and historical information for ESA-listed rockfish to support the 5-year review."
