description: "Shellfish are central to Washington State’s culture, marine ecosystems and coastal economies. Washington is the nation’s leading producer of farmed clams, oysters, and mussels, contributing approximately $184 million to the State economy, supporting over 1,900 jobs, and supplying fresh shellfish to consumers around the globe. With such high cultural, economic, and ecological value, there is substantial demand for growth within the shellfish aquaculture industry. A key impediment to the sustainable expansion of shellfish aquaculture is understanding the ecological implications of converting nearshore habitat to shellfish production. Understanding how shellfish aquaculture functions as nearshore habitat, relative to uncultivated areas, will help resource managers overcome this barrier and assess potential tradeoffs when planning the sustainable expansion of shellfish aquaculture. To better understand the ecological functions of these habitats, we need to examine not only which species are present, but how those species use each habitat. The goal of this study is to quantify the impacts (positive, negative, neutral) of shellfish aquaculture on foraging experiences of fish and crabs. We will collaborate with the National Marine Fisheries Service to examine (1) feeding behavior of these organisms using an extensive dataset of underwater video and (2) their trophic ecology (diets, isotopes) by sampling sites within the Salish Sea. Results from this work will inform decisions about the introduction of aquaculture in a system comprised of a diversity of seascapes and where considerable management attention is invested in conserving species that rely on nearshore waters and their essential habitats."
