description: "We developed and applied an integrated population model for natural-origin Chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) from the Willamette River basin. The model was developed with the intent of investigating the possible effects of present-day river flows and temperature on the recruitment of adults, in the hope of informing future consequences to fish and wildlife owing to possible changes in reservoir operations. Unfortunately, temperature records we incomplete across several consecutive years, which precluded their use in the model. Flow metrics were generated through a collaborative process with the Science of Willamette Instream Flows Team (SWIFT), and focused on effects of flow during particular life stages based on first principles (_e.g._, decreased flows during the summer may negatively affect parr survival). SWIFT derived 32 different flow scenarios that included the following periods/life stages: prespawning, egg incubation, rearing of age-1 parr, age-1 outmigrants, and age-2 outmigrants.. <br><br>You can find our data, code, and results [here](https://github.com/mdscheuerell/willamette)."
