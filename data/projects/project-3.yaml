description: "Kokanee salmon in Lake Sammamish, Washington were once abundant to support sustainable fisheries, but have declined precipitously since the mid-1970s. Although loss of spawning habitat and degradation of water quality have been identified as drivers of their decline, changes in the predator and prey communities are also suspected to have played a role. The goal of this project is to estimate the sizes of the piscivorous fish (predators) and zooplankton and macroinvertebrates (prey) communities, and characterize their diets (fish predators). We will work in cooperation with state, county, and tribal agencies to maximize our spatial and temporal sampling and minimize the overlap of existing efforts. The results of this research will help inform ongoing recovery efforts for this species of greatest concern, particularly with respect to proposed adaptive management options."
