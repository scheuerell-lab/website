In addition to his research, Markus is also passionate about mentoring, teaching, and advancing equity in science. Prior to coming to SAFS, he completed his BS in Marine Biology at UCLA and worked as a research assistant in the Biological Oceanography Group at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). While his research at both UCLA and MBARI was focused on the new, exciting field of environmental DNA (eDNA), it was his time spent studying groundfish as an intern at <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/"><strong>NOAA Fisheries</strong></a> that inspired him to return to Seattle to study fisheries science and marine ecology at SAFS. In addition to his academic interests, Markus enjoys playing music, baking, fishing, hiking, and soccer.

            <p class="team-bio">Amirah is studying the synergistic effects of contaminants and climate change on Pacific salmon. She graduated from Western Washington University with a BS in Marine and Coastal Science with a minor in Spanish. While at WWU, Amirah took part in research on the effects of PCBs and PBDEs on zebrafish and surf smelt. During her four years as an undergraduate, she was a marine science education intern at foundry10, the first undergraduate to teach a lab section of organismal biology, and peer mentor for the Marine and Coastal Science program. She is collaborating with the NOAA ecotoxicology group on a new land use mapping project, focused on interactions between urban growth, imperviousness, increasing toxic runoff, and expanding thermal stress in freshwater salmon habitats. In addition to her studies in SAFS, Amirah is a member of the <a href="https://futurerivers.uw.edu/"><strong>Future Rivers</strong></a> program and participates in outreach and education with <a href="https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/"><strong>SEAS</strong></a> . Besides school and work, Amirah enjoys going to the gym, exploring the city with friends, and reading a wide variety of genres.</p>

            <p class="team-bio">Callie is a sophomore majoring in Aquatic &amp; Fishery Sciences and planning to minor in Quantitative Science. She is exploring the fisheries field and has an interest in freshwater ecology and conservation. With a grant from <a href="https://creoi.org/"><strong>Conservation, Research and Education Opportunities International</strong></a>, Callie is working with PhD student Markus Min and collaborators at WDFW to better understand spatial and temporal patterns of marine debris in Puget Sound. Callie volunteered at the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery in the fall of 2023 to help with coho and Chinook spawning, and has been interested in getting more hands-on experience ever since. Callie spent four weeks in SW Alaska during the summer of 2024 studying sockeye salmon and the freshwater ecosystems that support them. Callie enjoys playing roller derby, sewing, drawing, playing video games, and spending time with her roommates.</p>

Much of our research is focused on the development and application of statistical methods for analyzing temporal and spatial data, but we collect our own data as well. Please see below for some examples of recent projects in our lab. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In particular, our research relies on a combination of empirical data, quantitative analysis, and communication. We also pursue our scientific endeavors in an open science environment where we create accessible and reproducible workflows.</p>

                            <p align="justify" style="padding:0px 100px 0px">We are studying pink salmon in the Indian River, the lower course of which lies within the Sitka National Historical Park. Recent decades have seen what some believe to be unnaturally high pink salmon escapement in the river, which could be attributable to releases from the nearby Sheldon Jackson Hatchery. However, it is also possible that the recent high levels of abundance at Indian River may be consistent with those in the greater region. If the river is indeed seeing an unnatural overabundance of returners in the fall, the undue burden these salmon put on other aquatic species inhabiting the ecosystem would be  a cause of concern for park management. The goal of this project is to develop a statistical model of pink salmon abundance in northern SE Alaska. This model will be used to determine whether the abundances observed at Indian River are convincingly out of line with those seen elsewhere in the region. This effort requires the integration of pink and chum salmon survey data from multiple data sources in order to inform the model and establish a &lsquo;curve&rsquo; on which to place the Indian River.</p>

Although loss of spawning habitat and degradation of water quality have been identified as drivers of their decline, changes in the predator and prey communities are also suspected to have played a role. The goal of this project is to estimate the sizes of the piscivorous fish (predators) and zooplankton and macroinvertebrates (prey) communities, and characterize their diets (fish predators). We will work in cooperation with state, county, and tribal agencies to maximize our spatial and temporal sampling and minimize the overlap of existing efforts. The results of this research will help inform ongoing recovery efforts for this species of greatest concern, particularly with respect to proposed adaptive management options.</p>

Recovery goals for toxics typically mean reductions in contamination to levels that make the organisms safe for people to consume, or to levels that will not harm the animals. The design of this monitoring program will additionally consider recovery goals specifically tailored to communities impacted by contaminants in the nearshore. This project is intended to cut across otherwise disparate monitoring and recovery efforts, by joining ecological ideas with the social sciences to bring a more meaningful and environmentally just approach to ecosystem recovery. It will specifically seek out affected communities typically excluded from such decision-making, consider non-traditional concepts of health and vitality, and honor the full diversity of cultures using these resources.</p>

                            <p align="justify" style="padding:0px 100px 0px">Artificial light at night (ALAN) is increasing nighttime brightness and expanding the time and area where salmon predators are highly effective foragers. Extended periods of elevated light can lead to decreased juvenile salmon survivorship during rearing and migration. Predation on juvenile salmon by fish predators is a main source of mortality for the Lake Washington salmon population. This population has experienced significant declines in the past few decades despite a longstanding moratorium on fishing. In collaboration with the WRIA-8 group and USGS, this project aims to identify areas of increased predation pressure due to ALAN in hopes of increasing juvenile salmon survival in the watershed. The objectives of this project are to 1) quantify the amount and seasonal trends of artificial light in the watershed at the surface and at depth 2) evaluate predation risk to juvenile salmon under current light levels using hydroacoustic sampling and previously developed visual foraging models 3) identify predation hot spots and to prioritize mitigation efforts.</p>
