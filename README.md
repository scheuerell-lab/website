This is the development repo for the Scheuerell Lab's website. The design is based largely upon the [Creative Theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-creative-theme) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with some additional elements from the (now archived) [Agency Theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-agency-theme).
