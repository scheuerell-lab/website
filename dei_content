<p>I am deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field, so students who contribute to our variety of backgrounds, opinions, and approaches are especially welcome. In particular, I encourage you to contact me if you are <a href="https://www.washington.edu/dreamproject/who/"><b>a first-generation college student or a student from a low-income background</b></a>, if you are <a href="https://www.washington.edu/raceequity/"><b>a member of a racial or ethnic minority</b></a>, if you identify as <a href="https://www.washington.edu/womenscenter/"><b>a woman</b></a> or as <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/qcenter/wordpress/"><b>LGBTQIA2+</b></a>, or if you have <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/"><b>a disability</b></a>.  UW is a great place for people who are historically underrepresented in the sciences, with <a href="https://www.washington.edu/omad/about-omad/"><b>many support resources across campus</b></a>.</p>
